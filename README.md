# CompoundingPeriods2
Software that uses C++ to output the principal amount, years invested, the compounding periods to find the final balance. Input is solely from a file, no user input. 

Similar purpose as CompoundingPeriods1, however that project was focused on getting user input and this project is using input from a file. The file consists of the principle amount 'P', years invested 'y', compounding periods 'cperiods', and the interest rate 'interestRate.' The point of this project was to extract the information from a file and use those values to plug into the final balance formula.

Console Window output will be found in Issues.
